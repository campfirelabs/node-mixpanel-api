Note: All examples and the implementation are in [coffee-script](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/). CoffeeScript is great and you should probably use it. If you don't want to use CoffeeScript, you can easily convert these examples using the 'Try CoffeeScript' button on the aforementioned website or using the `coffee` command-line utility.

      # `res` is the JSON-parsed response from the server.
      # example:
